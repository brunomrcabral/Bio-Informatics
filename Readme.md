Implement dynamic program alignment using your own program and access to a WEB server. You should:
- Align 2 real proteins and 2 real genes, from the same family but from different specimens, using linear cost.
- Alignment on a remote server using SOAP or REST
- Multiple paths
- Align alignment
- Interface

You can use the [EMBOSS] package (http://emboss.sourceforge.net/) for testing and comparison.

Implementation of HMMs:

- Implement the Viterbi and Forward Algorithms for HMMs.
- Try to apply these algorithms on a bacterial genome, eg. E-Coli
- Train the algorithms (do not need to forward).
- Compare using for training the bacteria itself, a similar bacterium and another more distant.
